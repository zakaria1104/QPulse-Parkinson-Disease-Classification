🧠 Parkinson’s Disease Classification: Classical vs Quantum Approaches

This project focuses on the classification of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using both classical machine learning models and quantum machine learning (QML) techniques. Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, making early and accurate diagnosis crucial for timely treatment and better patient outcomes.

🎯 Problem Statement

The goal is to build and evaluate classification models capable of distinguishing between Parkinson’s patients and healthy controls based on biomedical data. Traditional machine learning methods have shown strong performance, but as quantum computing matures, QML offers promising new paradigms for handling complex datasets and exploring potential quantum advantages.

⚙️ Classical Approaches

We implemented and benchmarked several well-established models:

XGBoost

CatBoost

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest (RF)

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Logistic Regression

⚛️ Quantum Approaches

For the quantum side, we explored feature encoding strategies and variational circuits to embed classical data into quantum states and train quantum models:

Encoding Methods:

ZZFeatureMap

PauliFeatureMap (with and without entanglement)

Quantum Ansatz & Models:

StronglyEntanglingLayers

Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM)

📊 Contribution

By comparing classical and quantum approaches, this project aims to:

Highlight the strengths and limitations of each paradigm.

Explore how different feature maps and ansatz choices impact performance.

Provide a reproducible pipeline for researchers and enthusiasts interested in applying Quantum Machine Learning to healthcare problems.
